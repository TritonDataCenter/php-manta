## Usage

For usage examples, see the directory `examples` for some sample scripts that
use the API.

## Subuser Difficulties

A common problem with subusers is that you haven't granted the subuser access to the
path within Manta. Typically this is done via the [Manta CLI Tools](https://apidocs.joyent.com/manta/commands-reference.html)
using the [`mchmod` command](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/blob/master/docs/man/mchmod.md).

For example:

```bash
mchmod +subusername /user/stor/my_directory
```

Kudos to the original author of php-manta - [Robert Bates](https://twitter.com/arpieb). He developed the library 
to be used with the Drupal [Backup & Migrate Manta plugin](https://www.drupal.org/project/backup_migrate_manta) 
and did all of the initial heavy lifting. On January 4th 2016, Robert transferred ownership of the repository to
Joyent and changed the license from the GPLv3 to the MPLv2.

## Credits
Kudos to the original author of php-manta - [Robert Bates](https://twitter.com/arpieb). He developed the library 
to be used with the Drupal[Backup & Migrate Manta plugin](https://www.drupal.org/project/backup_migrate_manta) 
and did all of the initial heavy lifting. On January 4th 2016, Robert transferred ownership of the repository to
Joyent and changed the license from the GPLv3 to the MPLv2.

## License
